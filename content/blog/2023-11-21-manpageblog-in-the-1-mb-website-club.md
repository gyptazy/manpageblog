<a href="https://github.com/gyptazy/manpageblog">manpageblog</a> is now part of the <a href="https://1mb.club">1MB Club</a>, a collection of performance-focused web pages.
The <a href="https://1mb.club">1MB Club</a> is a growing collection of performance-focused web pages weighing less than 1 megabyte. Therefore, the goal
is to get back to slim and performant but also content rich web pages again.<br><br>

<b>About the 1MB Club</b><br>
The internet has become a bloated mess. Massive JavaScript libraries. Countless client-side queries. Overly complex frontend frameworks.
But we can make a difference - no matter how small it may seem. 1MB Club is a growing collection of performance-focused web pages found across the internet. All member websites weigh less than 1 megabyte in page size.
