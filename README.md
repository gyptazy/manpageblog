## General
`manpageblog` is a small, lightweight blog engine written in Python and offers several advantages. Firstly, it provides simplicity and ease of use, making it accessible even for users with limited technical knowledge. The lightweight nature ensures quick installation and minimal resource consumption, making it suitable for various hosting environments. No database is needed at all.

Python's readability and straightforward syntax make the blog engine easy to customize and extend, allowing users to tailor it to their specific needs. Additionally, being Python-based means leveraging a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, enhancing the blog's functionality without unnecessary complexity. Posts and pages are written in Markdown or HTML while the blog engine generates the whole website. While using only flat files, this offers great possibilities in maintaining the content. Given this approach, you can manage your whole blog in git.

The lightweight nature also contributes to faster loading times, improving user experience and search engine rankings. Overall, a small, lightweight blog engine in Python combines simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for those prioritizing a streamlined and customizable blogging experience.

To support this small and lightweight expression of the blog engine the default theme represents a `man page` (manual page or also known as handbook) design which provides all needed information in a simple document.

## Motivation
Like probably the most ones I started with Worpess which is a pretty cool but very bloated software for a personal blog. Running such a software requires multiple application with different dependencies, continuous updates and more resources on the system to serve the whole content. Creating additional backups for the docroot and the database require additional time and efforts. All of this is not really necessary when the content is more or less static and comments are deactivated. A flat file approach provides the optional possibility to run and keep everything in git. Generated HTML pages can easily be served even on low resource systems like Raspberry PI etc.
